# Activity: Scrum

## Task 1: Reverse Engineering
1. Website Exploration: Please visit https://www.amazon.com/ to familiarize yourself with its functionalities

>Explored amazon and logged in 
 
2. Instead of starting with user stories, you will deduce user stories after exploring the website. For instance, consider actions like registration and login.

> - As a new user, I want to sign up using my email and password so that I can start shopping online.
> - As a customer, I want a simple checkout process with minimal form filling so that I can complete my purchase easily.
> - As a user, I want personalized product recommendations so that I can discover products I’m likely to be interested in.

## Task 2
1. Understanding the Roles: Discuss the role of the Product Owner within Scrum. What does a Product Owner do?
>Role:  responsible for maximizing the value of a product by setting the product vision, defining features, and prioritizing the work for the development team
>Responsibilities:
> - Define product vision: Establish and communicate a clear vision for the product.
Manage the product backlog: Create, prioritize, and refine the product backlog, which contains all work to be done.
> - Clearly communicate product vision and goals to the development team.
> - Accept or reject completed work during the sprint review.

2. Scrum Master's Necessity: Consider whether having a Scrum Master is required for this scenario.

> A Scrum Master is helpful for this scenario to guide the team through Scrum practices, track progress, and remove obstacles, even if the team is small and could self-organize.

3. Creating User Stories: Collaborate to build the product backlog and define more user stories. Use the format: "As a ... , I need ..., so that ..."

> -As a new user, I want to sign up with my email and password, so that I can start shopping online.
-As a registered user, I want to have a personalized experience after logging in .
-As a user, I want to search for products, so that I can find what I need quickly.
-As a user, I want to be able to save my shopping cart items so that I can come back later to check it out.

4. Sprint Backlog: Develop a sprint backlog by breaking user stories into tasks required for the prototype development.

5. Understanding Burndown Chart: Discuss the meaning and significance of a burndown chart in the context of Scrum.

> Graph showing remaining work vs. time in a sprint.
Significance:
> - Tracks progress.
> - Shows if the team is on schedule.
> - Helps the Scrum Master identify errors early on .

6. Ceremonies Exploration: Discuss the three key Scrum ceremonies: sprint planning, daily scrum, and sprint review.

> - Sprint Planning: Decide which user stories to implement in the sprint and break them into tasks.
> - Daily Scrum: 15-minute meeting to discuss progress, obstacles, and next steps.
> - Sprint Review: At the end of the sprint, demonstrate what’s done and collect feedback.

7. Backlog Clarification: Discuss the distinction between the product backlog and the sprint backlog.
> Product Backlog = “everything we want to do.”
> Sprint Backlog = “what we will do in this sprint, broken into actionable tasks.”
